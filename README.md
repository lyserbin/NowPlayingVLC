# NowPlayingVLC
Yeah, a free version of NowPlaying.<br/>
I won't support any kind of support of this project, there will be a single commit and I won't update it, don't even ask.<br/>

## Licensing

The file 'TelnetInterface.cs' is not mine, it is of Tom Janssens, I took it from code project, all right reserved to him.<br/>
All the other files are released under the Beerware license (read the full license on LICENSE).<br/>

## Compiling

Open the solution with VisualStudio, switch to Release mode and you are ready to go.<br/>

## How to use

Enable 'Telnet' and 'QT Interface' under 'Tools->Preferences->Show Settings:All->Main interfaces', then under 'Main interfaces->Lua' set a password (if you want you can change the port too).<br/>
Now copy 'sampleconf.xml' and rename it to 'nowplayingvlc.conf.xml', and put it in the same path of 'NowPlaying.exe'.<br/>
Edit 'nowplayingvlc.conf.xml' to match the config you setted up in VLC.<br/>
Run NowPlayingVLC and you are done ^^<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your *FREE* software o/
